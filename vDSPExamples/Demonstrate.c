/*	This next section defines some things to change the floating-point
	math environment.  Both AltiVec and Intel (IA-32 and EM64T) processors
	execute floating-point operations more quickly when they can treat
	subnormal numbers as zero, so we want to enable that mode.

	In summary:

		PowerPC and Intel processors can be set to handle subnormal
		floating-point numbers (essentially those with tiny exponents,
		very near zero) as specified by the IEEE 754 floating-point
		standard or to convert such numbers to zero when they are used
		or produced in floating-point arithmetic instructions.  Let us
		call the former mode "conformant" and the latter mode "fast".

		On some PowerPC processors, in conformant mode, all vector
		floating-point arithmetic instructions take an extra CPU cycle.

		On some Intel processors, in conformant mode, vector
		floating-point arithmetic instructions that encounter a
		subnormal number generate a trap that may take around a
		thousand CPU cycles to handle.

	On Intel processors, code compiled with Apple GCC uses vector
	instructions for all floating-point arithmetic.  Thus, all
	floating-point arithmetic is affected if a subnormal is encountered and
	is affected by the selection of conformant mode or fast mode.

	Because the penalty on PowerPC processors affects all applications
	with vector floating-point instructions, you will want to set fast mode
	unless your application requires proper handling of subnormal numbers.

	Because the penalty on Intel processors only affects applications when
	subnormal numbers are encountered, your application might not suffer
	any penalty, and you could leave the processor in conformant mode (the
	default).  However, if subnormal numbers are encountered, the
	performance penalty can be huge.  It can also be intermittent, causing
	erratic operation that is fast sometimes and slow sometimes.  To avoid
	this, you can set fast mode.

	The following section defines:

		MathEnvironment

			An object type that can record the floating-point
			environment.

		FastMathEnvironment

			An environment in which fast mode is set.

		MathEnvironment SetMathEnvironment(MathEnvironment New)

			A function that sets a new environment and returns the
			old one.

			Note that SetMathEnvironment sets the entire
			environment, not just the mode for which subnormal
			numbers are handled.  Notably, the AltiVec saturation
			bit is changed and the Intel rounding and exception
			bits are changed.

	You can use the symbols above to set the environment without
	additional information about the details.  For those who wish to know
	the details of the modes:

		On PowerPC, the subnormal handling is controlled by the
		non-Java mode bit.  Non-Java mode is the fast mode, and Java
		mode is the conformant mode.  It is unfortunate the mode is
		named in the negative, as a non-Java mode rather than a Java
		mode, but it is that way in the AltiVec specification.

		On Intel, the subnormal handling is controlled by two bits in
		the MXSCR, the FZ (flush-to-zero, subnormal outputs are
		replaced by zero) and DAZ (denormals-are-zeros, subnormal
		inputs are replaced by zero).

		the necessary processor register.  However, such code is of
		course not generally portable to other compilers.)
